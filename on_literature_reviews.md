## Regarding Literature Reviews

**What is a literature review?**

A literature review is a summary and critical evaluation of all the knowledge pertaining to a specific research question, which has already been established by other researchers.  Therefore it is a critical synthesis of previous research pertaining to a research question. A literature review forms a select analysis of existing research which is relevant to your topic. It also identifies the gaps in the field, and critically comments on the methods of the previous research. A literature review is NOT a straightforward summary of everything you have read on the topic and it is not a chronological description of what was discovered in your field.

**What is the aim of a literature review?**

To provide a narrative to the following questions:

1. What has already been investigated concerning the research question?
2. What can be inferred from these investigations?
3. How can the above direct future research?

Consider:

1. What has been said.
2. Who the key writers are.
3. What are the prevailing theories and hypotheses.
4. What questions are being asked.
5. What methodologies are appropriate and useful.

###Â Writing a Literature Review

1. First briefly explain the broad issues related to your question. You don't need to write much about this, just demonstrate that you are aware of the breadth of your subject. ***This can be covered in the abstract and throughout a section within the introduction.***
2. Then narrow your focus to deal with the studies that specifically related to the subject area of your question. ***This may be somewhat difficult, as we are not actually proposing a research question (or multiple research questions - or any kind of hypothesis), but simply summarising and critiquing the literature.***
3. Finally, hone in on any research which is directly related to your specific research question. Proportionally you spend most time discussing those studies which have most direct relevance to your research.

### Features of a Good Literature Review

1. Contains a synthesis of available research.
2. Provides a critical evaluation.
3. Offers appropriate breadth and depth.
4. Has clarity and conciseness.
5. Uses rigorous and consistent methods.
