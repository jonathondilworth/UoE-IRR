* Brief introduction to the field.
* Brief overview of the field.
* Summarised latest (and interesting) developments.
* Include the structure of the report.
* What conclusions are found within the report. Anything interesting? Future topics for research, perhaps proposed research questions.

**Introduction**

* Broad overview of the topic (machine learning and applications of machine learning). Make sure this is clearly defined.
* Stress the importance of the chosen topic (machine learning and its applications), this could be used as a means of providing motivation.
* Provide an identification of the major trends and contextualise the review topic.

***This is the main body and needs to be organised into subsections***

* Include a comprehensive list of hypotheses that are intended to be assessed within the review.
* Include a comprehensive and accurate list of key papers.
* Provide a detailed understanding of a small number of key papers.
* Offer a critical analysis and evaluation of methods.
* Provide coherent conclusions justified by cited papers (I am assuming this means conclusions that overlap between different papers).
* Suggest potentially fruitful approaches to future research in the topic area.
* Offer an identification of gaps within the field.
