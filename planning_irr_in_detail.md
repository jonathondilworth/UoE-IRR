## Planning IRR in Detail

**To Do (overview):**

* Select 3 or 4 papers from the seed papers.
* Critically evaluate the selected papers, learning how to test existing theories and systems on hypotheses and concrete examples devised by the student.
* Deliver a balanced report.

**Skills:**

* Reading at different levels of depth.
* Locating relevant papers.
* Organising the material.
* Managing time.

**Organising the Material:**

* What were the key ideas?
* When and whom did they appear from?
* How were they propagated?
* What were the dead ends?
* Rival approaches and hot issues?
* Try and tell a story about the development of the research.

**To Do (now):**

Evaluate good and bad examples.

Identify themes, styles and techniques within the papers which are reusable.

Integrate the aforementioned themes, styles and techniques into your planning.

Read and evaluate the following seed papers:

* ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
* A Model for Learning the Semantics of Pictures
* Pixel Recurrent Neural Networks
* *Noise-contrastive estimation: A new estimation principle for unnormalised statistical models*
* *Galileo: Perceiving Physical Object Properties by Integrating a Physics Engine with Deep Learning*

Identify fringe papers.

Put a solid plan together using the resources available on the wiki + IRR pages.
