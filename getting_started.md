## Getting Started

* What research has already been done on this topic?
	* Refer to already established, peer-reviewed papers.
* What are the sub-areas of the topic you need to explore?
	* Learning of different types (reinforcement, supervised, etc).
	* Various applications:
		* Medical
		* NLP
		* Image Recognition (AlexNet)
		* Games (GO - reinforcement ensemble)
		* etc.
* What other research (perhaps not directly on the topic) might be relevant to your investigation?
* How do these sub-topics and other research overlap with your investigation?

Note down all your initial thoughts on the topic. You can use a spidergram or list to help you identify the areas you want to investigate further. It is important to do this before you start reading so that you don't waste time on unfocussed and irrelevant reading.

### Searching for Sources

Use databases & Use journal articles. They normally have the most up-to-date research and you will be expected to refer to them in your literature review.

### Exercise

Find between one and three key papers related to your topic and write a short summary about the papers (1 page maximum). Address the following points:

* What question did the study address? (What was their hypothesis?)
* How did the study address the questions? (What sort of experiments did they conduct?)
* What were the results and conclusions of the authors?
* What is your conclusion?
* Do you agree?
* Do you have any criticism? (well motivated and clear problem? methods valid? testing? inference - does it follow from the results?) 

### Further

What are the stages your work might follow:

Similar to primary research, development of the literature review requires four stages:

1. Decide your topic and what are its component and related issues.
2. Search for relevant material.
3. Evaluation (which literature is significant & relevant), 15-20 papers cited => 30-50 papers read (1hr/paper: infeasible).
4. Analyse.
5. Interpret (discussing the findings and conclusions of papers you read).
6. Infer (what do all the facts mean).
